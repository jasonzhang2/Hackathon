    <p style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
      To play the game use "F" and "J" keys on the keyboard to capture moving notes
      between two vertical black lines. The space between the two black lines is called the strike zone. 
      Each time you hit the note in the strike zone will increase by 100. The game will last until 5 notes in a row are missed.
      The default gamemode is endless mode where notes are randomly regerated, and the speed of the notes can be changed.
      Once you press on the "Song Mode" button the game mode will change. In song mode you will play the notes to a song.
      Therefore the speed of the notes in "Song Mode" cannot be changed.
